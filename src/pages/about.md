Hello!

I'm a 16 year old who likes web development, reverse engineering, & hacking things. I hope to go into the cybersecurity or software engineering field when I'm older.

Projects I've worked on:

- [Family Link Codegen GUI](https://github.com/anti-link/fl_codegen_gui)
  - A GUI that implements the TOTP code for Google's parental controls.
- [Incognito](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Incognito)
  - A highly sophisticated web proxy site.
- [Nebula](https://github.com/NebulaServices/Nebula)
  - a stunning and sleek web proxy with support for hundreds of popular sites.

Amazing teams I've worked with:

- [Mercury Workshop](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop)
  - Mercury Workshop is an organization of developers dedicated to writing free and open source software for everyone
- [AntiLink](https://github.com/anti-link)
  - a group of software developers focused on hacking and reversing parental control and spyware software.

I hope you enjoy reading whatever I have on this site that you have interest in!
